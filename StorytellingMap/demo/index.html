				<p>At the mercy of mother nature, the consumer must do their research before stepping foot into the ski resort's parking lot,
					from reading the snow report, to examining the interactive lift and trail maps, to viewing recent social media tags for first-hand reports.</p>
				<p>In addition to ensuring the right weather conditions for skiing, the consumer also has to purchase necessary lift tickets,
					book lessons and rentals (if needed), as well as secure transportation, and possibly lodging.</p>
				<p>To first timers this could be daunting, and to regulars this could be cumbersome.
					Ski resorts have spent the better part of the last decade to implement tech in place to meet the needs of the consumer.</p>

				<p>With RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology, you can just place a credit card-sized pass in your left sleeve pocket.
					The RFID chip in the pass tells the lift systems who you are and opens the gates that allow entry to chairlifts.
					The cards also doubles in purpose, and tracks movements on the mountain, which aid in operational reporting and analysis and assists ski patrol in finding lost patrons.</p>
				<p>Many resorts are further streamlining the process by allowing guests to add days to their pass online or at electronic kiosks,
					eliminating that long wait at the ticket counter, so you could in essence skip the lodge and go from your parking lot directly to the lifts.</p>

				<p>This process should be seamless, after all, lift tickets alone account for up to <strong> 50% </strong> of the revenue of ski resorts.
					So why not make this process as easy as possible, and give customers every reason to return and spend more.</p>

				<p>There are <strong>6,138</strong> ski resorts worldwide, of that <strong>532</strong> ski areas in the United States, and <strong>292</strong> ski area in Canada.
				</p>
				<p>The daily capacity limit vary by resort and town size, however, the capacity limits for select resorts are as follows to provide a rough idea:<br/>

					<br/>
					Arapahoe Basin: 4,120<br/>
					Aspen Mountain: 4,610<br/>
					Beaver Creek: 18,650<br/>
					Breckenridge: 20,190<br/>

			<p>No snow, no problem: Ski resorts push season passes over pay-as-you-go tickets to secure sales for the coming season.
				In the words of the Denver-based magazine 5280, Vail's 2008 Epic Pass "threw a knuckleball" at the ski industry by
				slashing the price of a ski pass and giving skiers unlimited access to all of the company's resorts,
				a move that was seen as crazy at the time but has gone on to change the business.

				"They did a very good job of creating a market where skiers and snowboarders that didn't
				necessarily live near a resort would still want to buy a season pass," said Todd Burnette, CEO of the Mountain Collective.
				Rival businesses responded by launching their own multi-resort passes — products that give skiers access to multiple resorts
				and go on sale well before the season starts.</p>

					is that for the first time in decades skiing in America is reliably profitable.</p>

				<p>As winter is only just one of four seasons, resorts must get creative during the off season to stay profitable.  From mountain biking, to golf, venue rentals, to zip lining the options are endless
				and the member management systems cannot be entirely tailored to just winter sports.  Resorts also have a slew of non skiing and snowboarding
				services they provide during the in season as well.  So it is important to have system which looks out for other revenue streams.

				<h2><span class="title-up">Mogul Mayhem</span><span class="title-down">Industry Trends</span></h2>
				<p><strong>3/4</strong> of all global transactions are made on mobile, and this trend does not change for recreational activities.
					Therefore strong and secure mobile apps are needed for the consumer to research and purchase tickets and services needed online.</p>
				<p>US Consumers spent record of <strong>1 trillion</strong> dollars online in 2022, demonstrating that consumers would rather skip the physical queuing and
					pre-purchase online prior to arrival. </p>
				<p>There is a trend to build upon web presence to aid in consumer research.  Consumers value having their needs met over a lower price.
					Nearly <strong>1/2</strong> of consumers have decided not to book due to unmet needs.
					Given booking is done and will be done primarily online prior to
					arriving at the resort, it is important to ensure all needs are met and information is available online. </p>
				<p><strong>81 %</strong> of ski areas were understaffed in 2022, it is important to continue to build upon the technology to reduce the load of employees,
					this way staff can work in areas that cannot be automated through technology. </p>
				<p>RESORTS GONE CASHLESS - Not that many resort customers feel a need to access a reverse ATM, though;
					Snowbird’s machines averaged just 17 uses per day over the 2022-23 winter season, says Russell.</p>
				<p>An app for that. The transition has been so successful, SNOW Partners will take the next step this coming season,
					when guests will be required to have an app to pay for anything at the resorts. “People are ready for it,” Hession insists.
					“This is the future, that every guest has their own app and all transactions for them happen there.”.</p>

				<p>Not only does a balance of work and recreation improve our physical and mental health, but it also positively influences our occupational,
					emotional, and social health as well. Recreation—especially in nature—helps our brains relax and stimulates us cognitively, which results
					in greater productivity at work. Our brains also release more serotonin, a happiness hormone, which improves our moods, relieves stress,
					and makes us better colleagues, friends, and family members. In addition, recreation programs in a community can drive overall health outcomes,
					improve quality of life, and promote more inclusion by allowing us to get to know neighbors who are from different cultures
					or have different perspectives in a non-threatening environment. </p>
				<p>Skiing and snowboarding is a great time to put away our phones and unplug from modern society and enjoy what little time we have off.
					Ok, it's ok to take out your phone to snap a few pics, and spread the joy with your friends online. </p>
